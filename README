A small Scala Slick on-going experiment.
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In no way the contents of this project are the canonical way of doing things in Slick.

Notice that I avoid the cake pattern. Part of the credits for this goes to https://github.com/wiltonlazary.

Feedback is very welcome.

Run with:

$ sbt run   # Requires sbt 0.12 or later

TODOs:

 * Show more slick features
   * Use tagged types as way to distinct between IDs
   * Abstractions over common table columns
   * Filter methods
 * Improve names and classes locations

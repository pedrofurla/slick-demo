slick-demo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedrofurla/slick-demo.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pedrofurla/slick-demo)
==========

A small Scala Slick *on-going experiment* and demo.

It's also a small experiment in literate programming, but its overhead on the regular is very little.

In no way the contents of this project are the canonical way of doing things in Slick.

Notice that I avoid the cake pattern. Part of the credits for this goes to https://github.com/wiltonlazary.

**Feedback** is very welcome.

Run with:

$ sbt run   # Requires sbt 0.12 or later

Some of the features shown in this project:

  * Lifted Embedding
  * Custom data types
  * A little of query composition
  * And more

TODOs:

 * Show more slick features
   * Use tagged types as way to distinct between IDs
   * Abstractions over common table columns
   * Filter methods - column predication
 * Improve names and classes locations
 * Link above features to instances
